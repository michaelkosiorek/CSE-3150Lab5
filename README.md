Unit test the edep algorithm / other functions with: <br>
```g++ unit_tests_edep.cpp ints_read_matrix.cpp ints_read_vector.cpp expensive_digraph_ep.cpp``` <br>

One of the barbell graphs are manually tested in the unit tests, but I find it necessary to still give an explanation as to what happens in the process of those graphs. Take, for example, the length-10 graph provided to us as an example of the barbell graph.
